The pure-quantum code above is a bare quantum annealer call.
•	It takes a QUBO dictionary, sends it to the annealer (or simulated annealer/tabu search endpoint), and gives you back a bitstring + objective value.
•	There is no nonlinear update loop, no Chebyshev residual evaluation, no boundary-condition handling.
•	So it solves one static QUBO, not a nonlinear boundary value problem.
 
The hybrid Picard + annealer code would:
1.	Discretize the nonlinear BVP with Chebyshev collocation.
2.	Parameterize BCs so they are automatically satisfied.
3.	Build a residual-based QUBO for the current nonlinear coefficients.
4.	Send that QUBO to Automatski using the solver class you pasted.
5.	Decode the bitstring → approximate solution values.
6.	Update nonlinear terms with Picard iteration (outer loop).
7.	Repeat until residual norm converges.
That’s the hybrid framework: classical (Picard + Chebyshev residuals) + quantum (annealer for each QUBO subproblem).
 
✅ So to be precise:
•	Pure-quantum code = pure annealer solver (one-shot QUBO).
•	The Hybrid-quantum = hybrid Picard + annealer loop (full nonlinear solver).
